nvme-get-timestamp(1)
=====================

NAME
----
nvme-get-timestamp - Gets the timestamp feature ID data from the nvme controller.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme get-timestamp' <device>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Gets the timestamp feature id data from the NVMe controller.  The <device> parameter
is mandatory and must be an NVMe character device (ex: /dev/nvme0).

Returns the current timestamp value along the Timestamp Origin and Synch bits.  

If the origin field is set to 000b, then the returned timestamp value is set to the 
time in milliseconds since the last controller level reset.  If the origin field is 
set to 0001b, then the returned timestamp value is set to the last timestamp value
set by the host plus the time milliseconds since the timestamp was set.

The Origin/Synch field is a byte in length with bits defined as follows:

*  Bits 07:04  Reserved 
*  Bits 03:01  Timestamp Origin
**               000b - The timestamp field was initialized to '0' by a Controller Level Reset
**               001b - The timestamp field was initialized with a value using the set features command.
**               010b-111b - Reserved
*  Bit  00     Synch
**               0b - The controller counted time in milliseconds continuously since the timestamp value was initialized.
**               1b - The controller may have stopped counting during vendor specific intervals after the timestamp value was initialized.
