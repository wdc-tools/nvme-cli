==========================

NAME
----
nvme-wdc-get-crash-dump - Retrieve WDC device's crash dumps and save to files.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme wdc get-crash-dump' <device> [--output-file=<FILE>, -o <FILE>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, sends the WDC vendor unique crash dump
request and saves the result to file(s). In current implementation crash dump and
pfail dump are captured if they are present. On success it will save the dump(s) in
file(s) with appropriate suffix. Note that this command will clear the available
dump(s) from the device on success.

The <device> parameter is mandatory NVMe character device (ex: /dev/nvme0).

This will only work on WDC devices. Results for any other device are
undefined.

OPTIONS
-------
-o <FILE>::
--output-file=<FILE>::
	Output file; defaults to device serial number followed by "crash_dump" and "pfail_dump" suffix 

EXAMPLES
--------
* Gets the crash dump and pfail dump from the device and saves to default file(s) in current directory (e.g. STM00019F3F9crash_dump.bin & STM00019F3F9pfail_dump.bin):
+
------------
# nvme wdc get-crash-dump /dev/nvme0
------------
* Gets the crash dump and pfail dump from the device and saves to defined file(s) in current directory (e.g. testSTM00019F3F9crash_dump.bin & testSTM00019F3F9pfail_dump.bin):
+
------------
# nvme wdc get-crash-dump /dev/nvme0 -o test
------------
* Gets the crash dump and pfail dump from the device and saves to defined file(s) with pathname (e.g. /tmp/testSTM00019F3F9crash_dump.bin & /tmp/testSTM00019F3F9pfail_dump.bin):
+
------------
# nvme wdc get-crash-dump /dev/nvme0 -o /tmp/test
