nvme-wdc-smart-log-add(1)
=========================

NAME
----
nvme-wdc-smart-log-add - Send NVMe WDC smart-log-add Vendor Unique Command, return result

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme wdc smart-log-add' <device> [--output-format=<normal|json> -o <normal|json>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, send a Vendor Unique WDC smart-log-add command and
provide the additional smart CA log.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and may be either the NVMe character
device (ex: /dev/nvme0).

This will only work on WDC devices supporting this feature.
Results for any other device are undefined.

On success it returns 0, error code otherwise.

OPTIONS
-------
-o <format>::
--output-format=<format>::
	Set the reporting format to 'human', or
	'json'. Only one output format can be used at a time.
	Default is human.

|Field |Description

|*Physical NAND bytes written.*
|The number of bytes written to NAND.  16 bytes - hi/lo

|*Physical NAND bytes read*
|The number of bytes read from NAND.  16 bytes - hi/lo

|*Bad NAND Block Count*
|Raw and normalized count of the number of NAND blocks that have been
retired after the drives manufacturing tests (i.e. grown back blocks).
2 bytes normalized, 6 bytes raw count

|*Uncorrectable Read Error Count*
|Total count of NAND reads that were not correctable by read retries, all
levels of ECC, or XOR (as applicable).  8 bytes

|*Soft ECC Error Count*
|Total count of NAND reads that were not correctable by read retries, or
first-level ECC.  8 bytes

|*SSD End to End Detection Count*
|A count of the detected errors by the SSD end to end error correction which
includes DRAM, SRAM, or other storage element ECC/CRC protection mechanism (not
NAND ECC).  4 bytes

|*SSD End to End Correction Count*
|A count of the corrected errors by the SSD end to end error correction which
includes DRAM, SRAM, or other storage element ECC/CRC protection mechanism (not
NAND ECC).  4 bytes

|*System Data % Used*
|A normalized cumulative count of the number of erase cycles per block since
leaving the factory for the system (FW and metadata) area. Starts at 0 and
increments. 100 indicates that the estimated endurance has been consumed.

|*User Data Max Erase Count*
|The maximum erase count across all NAND blocks in the drive.  4 bytes

|*User Data Min Erase Count*
|The minimum erase count across all NAND blocks in the drive.  4 bytes

|*Refresh Count*
|A count of the number of blocks that have been re-allocated due to
background operations only.  8 bytes

|*Program Fail Count*
|Raw and normalized count of total program failures. Normalized count
starts at 100 and shows the percent of remaining allowable failures.
2 bytes normalized, 6 bytes raw count

|*User Data Erase Fail Count*
|Raw and normalized count of total erase failures in the user area.
Normalized count starts at 100 and shows the percent of remaining
allowable failures.  2 bytes normalized, 6 bytes raw count

|*System Area Erase Fail Count*
|Raw and normalized count of total erase failures in the system area.
Normalized count starts at 100 and shows the percent of remaining
allowable failures.  2 bytes normalized, 6 bytes raw count

|*Thermal Throttling Status*
|The current status of thermal throttling (enabled or disabled).
2 bytes

|*Thermal Throttling Count*
|A count of the number of thermal throttling events.  2 bytes

|*PCIe Correctable Error Count*
|Summation counter of all PCIe correctable errors (Bad TLP, Bad
DLLP, Receiver error, Replay timeouts, Replay rollovers).  8 bytes
